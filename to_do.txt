[x? (still jittery)] Implement proper physics solver
[x? (scalability is subjective)] Allow for scalability and having multiple particles
[x] Collisions with walls and other particles
[x] Spawning in particles
[x? (needs more tweaking, shaders too)] Color code particles based on some "temperature" (measure of energy, ig kinetic is good enough for now)
[x] Timesteps?
[] 3D mode + free camera
[x? (needs a lot more tweeking)] Blurred particles for "fluid" effect

The task of a lifetime :3
[] Optimize
